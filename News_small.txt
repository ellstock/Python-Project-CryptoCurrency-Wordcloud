"65139",1471996800,"Iguana Update""I pushed a new version with a LOT of changes. I estimate about 20% of the codebase is affected. Essentially I wrote a totally independent blockchain processor for the RT blocks, and connected the backend of it to the bundles data. Then I went through all the RPC and abstracted out all places where it referred to a historical bundle and changed it to a virtualized outpoint, which could be either realtime dataset or historical dataset. Then I made all places properly use the realtime data if it was there and historical data if not.At least that is what I tried and it appears to not crash, but this was a near non-stop coding for the last 5 days, so no guarantees of what works and doesnt.
