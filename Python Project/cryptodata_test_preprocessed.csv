1543522116,"                        A new development has arisen in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) efforts to regulate ICOs: a District Judge has turned back a request for an injunction.According to a recent legal briefing, San Diego District Judge Gonzalo Curiel has been presiding over a case between the SEC and the startup company Blockvest. On November 27, 2018, although Judge Curiel had previously granted the SECs ex parte request for a temporary restraining order and froze the assets involved in the ICO, he has now stated that the SEC couldnt demonstrate that buyers of Blockvests ICO expected to receive a profit. The SECs regulations regarding ICOs are a tricky and largely unresolved legal area, but this case and others have explicitly cited one 1946 court case: SEC vs. W.J. Howey Co. This case first codified into law that certain assets can be considered securities, and become subject to securities regulations, based on the way that sellers and customers handle them. One of the critical criteria for an offering such as an ICO to become a security under the Howey statute is for customers to demonstrate an expectation that they will eventually make more money from the purchase. According to Curiels recent comments, customers of the Blockvest ICO were under no such illusion. Curiels comments by themselves do not constitute a legal verdict, and the case is by no means sealed.

1543521811,"                        Jared Rice Sr., CEO of the Dallas-based bank AriseBank, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Wednesday, November 28, 2018, and charged with six counts of securities fraud and wire fraud. Rice is accused of scamming investors out of more than $4 million through a cryptocurrency scam that promised federally insured accounts and brand-name credit cards.Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SECs) regional office in Fort Worth, Texas, received an emergency court order to stop AriseBanks initial coin offering (ICO) for the cryptocurrency AriseCoin, which Rice falsely claimed had raised a whopping $600 million. According to the court filing, Rice reportedly lied to investors, saying that the bank  which he called the first decentralized banking platform  could offer customers FDIC-insured accounts, as well as traditional banking services such as Visa-brand credit and debit cards. Erin Nealy Cox  the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern District of Texas  states that AriseBank was not FDIC insured, nor did it have the authority to conduct banking operations in Texas. It also did not have an official partnership with Visa. Rice spoke of AriseBanks allegedly non-existent benefits online and through press releases while spending investor funds on hotel stays, clothing, meals, Uber rides, a family law attorney and guardian ad litem.

Rice is accused of scamming investors out of more than $4 million through a cryptocurrency scam that promised federally insured accounts and brand-name credit cards.Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SECs) regional office in Fort Worth, Texas, received an emergency court order to stop AriseBanks initial coin offering (ICO) for the cryptocurrency AriseCoin, which Rice falsely claimed had raised a whopping $600 million.

Erin Nealy Cox  the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern District of Texas  states that AriseBank was not FDIC insured, nor did it have the authority to conduct banking operations in Texas.

1543511322,"                        Cryptocurrency exchanges are catching up to their traditional counterparts, a new study suggests.According to a report released by global professional services company Accenture, revenue from cryptocurrency exchanges is now matching that of traditional exchanges. Some of the changes discussed in the document, Capital Markets Vision 2022, include the rise and growth of cryptocurrencies, and how blockchain technology could potentially help traditional firms unlock value and add new levels of efficiency to their operations. Traditional exchanges typically generate solid pre-tax margins, but their growth prospects tend to be modest at best, the document explains. Thus, many traditional firms have begun finding ways to bring cryptocurrency trading to their customers as a means of potentially increasing their revenue while offering investors the chance to build more diversified portfolios. The report says that cryptocurrency exchanges and servicing hold a 64 percent pre-tax margin. The authors say that, in just a few short years, crypto exchanges have exploded from virtually nowhere and now represent a substantial amount of revenue, matching that from traditional exchanges with a discrepancy in composition of margin and turnover that differs by a factor of roughly 1,000.

But the rationale behind his words is nothing his crypto-friendly audience hasnt heard before.Clayton explained that his agency might not approve a bitcoin ETF anytime soon as the agency's issues are yet to be addressed by market operators. Clayton singled out theft and manipulation of cryptocurrencies as two issues that need to be sorted out before the commission can give its blessings to an ETF, something that prior rejection orders have repeated ad infinitum. In these rejection orders, the SEC claims that each applicant has failed to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, continuing to say that novel systems intrinsic to this new market provide unique additional protections that are unavailable in traditional commodity markets, namely traditional means of identifying and deterring fraud and manipulation.These traditional means are surveillance sharing agreements, something the rejection orders stress as one of the avenues through which a product might win approval.
