Support currently appears to be established in the mid-$3,000s as the market remains indecisive over its next move:Figure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Current Support LevelFigure 1 shows the relevance of the current support level as it represents a previous support level that was never properly retested during last years parabolic bull market.

To date, bitcoin has realized a whopping 82% devaluation from its all-time high to the current low in the mid $3,500s. If our current support holds, we should expect to see a battle over the 78% retracement values where, if the overhanging retracement level breaks, we will likely encounter another level of resistance in the $5,000 region.

1543522116,"                        A new development has arisen in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) efforts to regulate ICOs: a District Judge has turned back a request for an injunction.According to a recent legal briefing, San Diego District Judge Gonzalo Curiel has been presiding over a case between the SEC and the startup company Blockvest. On November 27, 2018, although Judge Curiel had previously granted the SECs ex parte request for a temporary restraining order and froze the assets involved in the ICO, he has now stated that the SEC couldnt demonstrate that buyers of Blockvests ICO expected to receive a profit. The SECs regulations regarding ICOs are a tricky and largely unresolved legal area, but this case and others have explicitly cited one 1946 court case: SEC vs. W.J. Howey Co. This case first codified into law that certain assets can be considered securities, and become subject to securities regulations, based on the way that sellers and customers handle them. One of the critical criteria for an offering such as an ICO to become a security under the Howey statute is for customers to demonstrate an expectation that they will eventually make more money from the purchase. According to Curiels recent comments, customers of the Blockvest ICO were under no such illusion. Curiels comments by themselves do not constitute a legal verdict, and the case is by no means sealed. The briefing went on to state th..."
1543521811,"                        Jared Rice Sr., CEO of the Dallas-based bank AriseBank, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Wednesday, November 28, 2018, and charged with six counts of securities fraud and wire fraud. Rice is accused of scamming investors out of more than $4 million through a cryptocurrency scam that promised federally insured accounts and brand-name credit cards.Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SECs) regional office in Fort Worth, Texas, received an emergency court order to stop AriseBanks initial coin offering (ICO) for the cryptocurrency AriseCoin, which Rice falsely claimed had raised a whopping $600 million. According to the court filing, Rice reportedly lied to investors, saying that the bank  which he called the first decentralized banking platform  could offer customers FDIC-insured accounts, as well as traditional banking services such as Visa-brand credit and debit cards. Erin Nealy Cox  the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern District of Texas  states that AriseBank was not FDIC insured, nor did it have the authority to conduct banking operations in Texas. It also did not have an official partnership with Visa. Rice spoke of AriseBanks allegedly non-existent benefits online and through press releases while spending investor funds on hotel stays, clothing, meals, Uber rides, a family law attorney and guardian ad litem.

Some of the changes discussed in the document, Capital Markets Vision 2022, include the rise and growth of cryptocurrencies, and how blockchain technology could potentially help traditional firms unlock value and add new levels of efficiency to their operations. Traditional exchanges typically generate solid pre-tax margins, but their growth prospects tend to be modest at best, the document explains. Thus, many traditional firms have begun finding ways to bring cryptocurrency trading to their customers as a means of potentially increasing their revenue while offering investors the chance to build more diversified portfolios. The report says that cryptocurrency exchanges and servicing hold a 64 percent pre-tax margin. The authors say that, in just a few short years, crypto exchanges have exploded from virtually nowhere and now represent a substantial amount of revenue, matching that from traditional exchanges with a discrepancy in composition of margin and turnover that differs by a factor of roughly 1,000.
